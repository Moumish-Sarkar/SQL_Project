# SQL_Project


### Online Bookstore Data Analysis using SQL


* Created a fully functional relational database system to simulate an online bookstore environment.
* Designed and implemented three normalized tables: `Books`, `Customers`, and `Orders`, ensuring referential integrity through primary and foreign key constraints.
* Imported real-world datasets from CSV files into PostgreSQL using the `COPY` command.
* Wrote and executed 20+ advanced SQL queries to derive key business insights, including:

  * Identifying the most frequently ordered books and top-spending customers.
  * Calculating genre-wise total sales, average book prices, and remaining stock after orders.
  * Filtering customer orders by time range and geography to support targeted business strategies.
* Applied SQL features such as aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`), `JOINs`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, sorting, filtering, and subqueries.
* Demonstrated ability to work with structured data, perform meaningful analysis, and draw data-driven conclusions relevant to real-world business use cases.
